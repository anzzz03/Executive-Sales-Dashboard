# Executive-Sales-Dashboard
This repository contains the SQL code used in the first step of the Data Analysis Sales Project to extract data from the Database Bike_Stores and its several tables 
using queries and perform outer joins on the same so as to collect the relevant data for the project. The output of this SQL Query was imported and used in the next 
step in Microsoft Excel for the creation of required Pivot Charts and Tables. In the final step, a Tableau dashboard was created to present a summary of the sales and represent the profitability as per different criteria for the states of New York, California and Texas using pie charts, maps, treemaps, column charts and line charts to discover that the highest revenue was generated in the year 2017 by the store Baldwin Bikes with Trek Mountain Bikes being the top seller. The top 10 customers every year and revenue per sales rep were also displayed using horizontal bar charts.
